        8255 PPI Reset Fix
        ------------------

        Revision  0  of the 8085 Multi IO board contains a routing error.  The
        reset input to the 8255 PPI connects to 8085 SBC BUS pin 12, which  is
        the *MASK input.  It should be connected to 8085 SBC BUS pin 11.

            * Cut trace to 8085 SBC BUS (EXPANSION) pin 12 (bottom) above pins
              4 and 6

            * Jump 8255 reset input (pin 39, use via above cut) to 8085 SBC
              BUS (EXPANSION) pin 11

        Test  change  by  probing  8255  reset input (pin 39) and pressing the
        reset button on the 8085 SBC.

        This error has been corrected in the schematic, and will be  fixed  in
        any  future  etches.   The  error  is  present  "in the wild" on a few
        prototype boards that have been sold to hobbyists.

        The glitchwrks.com writeup for the 8085  Multi  IO  board  includes  a
        picture of this fix.

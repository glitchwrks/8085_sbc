        APPNOTE NUMBER: 0001
        DATE:           2023-03-27
        BOARD NAME:     8085 SBC REV 2
        BOARD REVISION: PRODUCTION


        IC3 Jumper Options
        ------------------

        The 8085 SBC rev 2 includes several option jumpers for configuring the
        device type installed in socket IC3.  This socket supports RAM, EPROM,
        EEPROM, bytewide Flash, and NVRAM.

        JP1  controls  socket IC3 pin 1.  JP1 pin 1 is the bottom pin when the
        SBC is oriented with the expansion connector  down.   Pin  assignments
        for JP1:

            * Pin 1 connects to A14
            * Pin 2 connects to socket IC3 pin 1
            * Pin 3 connects to VCC

        JP2  controls  socket  IC3 pin 26.  JP2 pin 1 is the leftmost pin when
        the  SBC  is  oriented  with  the  expansion  connector   down.    Pin
        assignments for JP2:

            * Pin 1 connects to A13
            * Pin 2 connects to socket IC3 pin 26
            * Pin 3 connects to VCC

        JP3  controls  IC3  pin 27.  JP3 pin 1 is the leftmost bottom pin when
        the  SBC  is  oriented  with  the  expansion  connector   down.    Pin
        assignments for JP3:

            * Pin 1 connects to *WR
            * Pin 3 connects to A14
            * Pin 5 connects to VCC
            * Even pins 2-6 (upper row) connect to socket IC3 pin 27

        The following table documents the available configurations:

        JP1 | JP2 | JP3 | Device(s) supported
        -------------------------------------------------------------------
        1-2 | 1-2 | 1-2 | 62256 32K SRAM type devices (28C256, NVRAM, etc.)
        1-2 | 1-2 | 5-6 | 62256 32K SRAM type devices, write-protected
        2-3 | 1-2 | 3-4 | 27256 32K EPROM
        2-3 | 1-2 | 5-6 | 27128 16K EPROM
        2-3 | N/A | 5-6 | 2764 8K EPROM
        N/A | 2-3 | N/A | Intel 2732 type EPROM

        Jumper  positions  marked  N/A  are  "don't  care"  and  can  be  left
        completely open.

        Devices smaller than 32K will repeat within the 0 - 32K lower  address
        block.

        27512  type  64K  x  8 EPROMs can be used in socket IC3 with the 27256
        configuration; however, the lower 32K will not be accessible.
